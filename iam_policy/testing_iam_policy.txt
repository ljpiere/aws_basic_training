We can simulate the behaviour of a IAM Policy using this link:

https://policysim.aws.amazon.com/

Steps

1. We have to create a User/Group with a policy.
2. Go to the simulator.
3. Select the user/group to test.
4. Select any service to check if the user/group have/has access to that item.

OK, so, what will we do next?

5. Try editing or creating another policy, attached it to the group/user and use the simulator again with another service.
