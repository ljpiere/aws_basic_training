# Executing a Docker image on a EC2

In this tutorial we weill create a EC2 instance executing a Docker image for a basic web site.

## Step 1: Log in into AWS console

Go to: https://aws.amazon.com/console/

## Step 2: Launch a EC2 Instance
Go to the EC2 dashboard and click on "Launch Instance" button. We can use these configurations for our instance:
**1. AMI:** Amazon Linux
**2. Instance type:** t3.micro
**3. Storage:** 8GB SSD Volume type

### Special configuraci√≥n for firewall
We have to set up the security group for our instance:
**1. SSH**: Set up Port 22 for your IP address or anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) (**WARNING!** This is a dangeorus configuration)
**2. HTTP:** Port 80 anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
**3. HTTPS:** Port 443 anuwhere 0.0.0.0/0
**4. Keys:** Select a key or generate a one new one.

Now we can launch the instance.

## Step 3: Connect to EC2 Instance
Open a terminal and connect to your instance using SSH. You can use the command: `ssh -`. Example:
```sh
ssh -i "your-key-file.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-public-dns
```
Maybe you have to change the .pem file permissions:
```
chmod 400 your-key-file.pem
```

## Step 4: Install Docker
In the EC2 terminal we have to install docker.
**1. Update the pacakge:** We have to update the `yum` files on our system:
```
sudo yum update -y
```

## **2. Install Docker package:** 
```
sudo yum install docker -y  # para Amazon Linux
# sudo apt install docker.io -y  # para Ubuntu
```

## **3. Start the Docker service in our system:**
```
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```
Notice that `ec2-user` is the user that we use to log in into the instance.

## **4. Restart the SSH connection:** 
Exit and log in into the instance again.

```
exit
ssh -i "your-key-file.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-public-dns
```

## **5. Pull Docker image:** 
We have to pull a docker image with a nginx engine configure. You can check the Docker file and the idnex.html in this repository. And also de docker image you'll check in Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jeanpierec/nginx-basic-html/general

In your EC2 instance yun:
```
sudo docker pull jeanpierec/nginx-basic-html:latest
```
## **6. Check docker status:** 
Check if our container is running.

```
docker ps
```

## **7. Expose Docker service:** 
We use port 80 for this example.

```
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 jeanpierec/nginx-basic-html:tagname
```

## **8. Copy public instance address:** 
Now we could check our web page. Please check that URL using HTTP protocol.


### Do you wanna edit the index.html file?

Well, you could create a new Docker image using the Dockerfile and the index.html in this repository.
